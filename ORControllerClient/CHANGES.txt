Version 0.3.0
=============

New features
------------

Continued conversion from all legacy model objects (except for "local commands" mechanism) to newer version.
This includes: ORSwitch, ORSlider, ORColorPicker, ORWebView, ORTabBar / ORTabBarItem, ORNavigation,
ORScreen, ORGroup, ORGesture, ORLayoutContainer, ORAbsoluteLayoutContainer, ORGridLayoutContainer, ORGridCell

Please see the detailed documentation of each class for more information.

Introduced ORModelObject as base class for all objects that are part of the panel object model.
definition property has been moved from ORWidget to ORModelObject.
This class also defines a name property that, for most objects, can be used freely by the client.
For ORScreen and ORGroup, it is pre-populated by the value that has been defined in the model.
For ORLabel, it is pre-populated with the text of the label as it is defined before any sensor update occur.

Changes from previous release
-----------------------------

On ORImage, renamed property 'name' to 'src', allowing addition of name as generic property on ORModelObject.

ORButton now references new ORNavigation object (instead of Navigation).

Removed isDynamic property from ORLabel/ORButton. It was never implemented correctly.

Fixed sensor update issue introduced in latest release.

Internal review to ensure better compatibility with iOS 7.1 / 64bit support

Version 0.2.0
=============

Added ORImage object representing images (replaces legacy Image model object).
- (NSSet *)images method on Definition returns all the images that are part of the design.

Added ORButton object representing a push button (no state feedback).
ORButton replaces legacy Button object.
ORButton object handles communication with controller.
UI code should use -press and -depress method to indicate when user taps and releases button.
- (NSSet *)buttons method on Definition returns all the buttons that are part of the design.

Added ORBackground object representing background of Screen (replaces legacy Background model object).
Screen is still a legacy model object and will be replaced in the future.

Fixed bug that would not take sensor states information from ORWidget (label or image) into account.

On Definition, method - (ORLabel *)findLabelById:(int)labelId is deprecated.
Method - (ORLabel *)findLabelByIdentifier:(ORObjectIdentifier *)identifier should be used instead.
